        "bio": "It’s everything you love about MINI…and more. Thanks to its unique layout and low centre of gravity, the MINI 5 door is ready to deliver the same corner-carving agility that made its 3-door brother famous. But with more doors, headroom, legroom, and cargo room, it may be the slightly better choice for anyone leading a slightly fuller life."
