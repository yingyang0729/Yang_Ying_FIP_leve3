## History
TODO: 
The FIP project is finished by Ying Yang. As the only developer, I would like to explain the project.
1. Home Page: I added my videos on the home page with HTML and JS. The video is controlled by JS but I did not think it was a fetch. I did not like adding videos but I also thought the JS skill should be shown. The home is only for display.
2. About: I finished the page with JSON and JS. I fetched all pictures and words by using JSON.
3. Artworks: I accomplished the page with JSONï¼ŒJS and Vue JS. On the the top of the page I added the Vue Router to attach pictures and text. I also used lgiht box on the bottom of the page.
4. Package: I completed the page with JSON, JS and Vue Js. This way is learned from Professor Trevor's classtime. I used three ways to fetch files so I set up three JSON files.
5. Contact: I have done the page with PHP, JS and Vue JS. It can send emails for any emails. I already fixed the problem. Now the contact page is working.
